Adobe extendscript that creates a keyline indicating the visible area of artwork.
## Function

Window that gives you the option of how far in on each side you want the keyline to be placed.
Acts like the canvas window where you can lock it at the corners sides or the center.
You can specify the thickness of the stroke on the outline. Once ran creates a cyan outline and document guides.
## BUGS and Known Issues
 - Cannot select color from the window must change in script, planning on adding that feature.
 - Have not tested on Windows.
